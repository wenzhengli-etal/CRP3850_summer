    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This homework will focus on checking the global and local spatial autocorrelation and point pattern analysis based on the Airbnb listing in New York City and the underlying socioeconomics. Through this practice, you will review the process of retrieving data from API, building spatial weights from georeferenced data, checking global and local spatial autocorrelation, and conducting point pattern analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Grading\n",
    "Each exercise will be graded based on the following rubrics:\n",
    "- 2 points. Completed the task, presented the expected results, and codes were well documented and explained.\n",
    "- 1 point. Completed the task with some disparity from the expected results.\n",
    "- 0 point. Did not complete the excercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Late submission policy\n",
    "For late submission, every extra day after the due date will lead to 20% off of your points. Less than a day will be counted as one day. All submissions after the TA team posts the answers will not be accepted."
